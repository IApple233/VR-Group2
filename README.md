## ðŸ“š Introduction

This project is a VR version of the Pacman game. The player need to transport a certain number of objects to designated locations within a maze while avoiding capture by ghosts. Please note that if players are captured by ghosts or move outside the boundaries of the maze, the game will end in failure.

## ðŸ“º Game Features

- A top-down mini-map located in the upper right corner that follows the player.
- Implement ghost navigation to automatically pathfind through the maze and capture the player.
- A timer that records the player's survival time.
- Player interaction with objects distributed throughout the maze.
